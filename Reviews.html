		  <h2><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2017/09/hands_on_dragon_ball_fighterz_could_end_up_being_one_of_the_best_anime_fighters_ever">Dragon ball Fighterz Best Anime Fighter?</a></h2>

		   <p><img src="images/figthersz.png" alt="Db Fighterz" align="middle">There have been a lot of Dragon Ball titles over the years, but only a handful of them can be considered truly good games. Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 immediately springs to mind, and the much more recent Dragon Ball XenoVerse series is no slouch</p>

		  <h2><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/doom_vfr">Doom Vr A Walk through virtual hell</a></h2>
		  </center>
		   <p><img src="images/Doomvr.png" alt="Doomvr" align="middle">DOOM VFR really, really tries. Unlike the Elder Scrolls adaptation, id Software’s opted to recycle locations from its 2016 title and build a new story around them.At the end of the day, it’s DOOM so the plot doesn’t matter at all</p>

		  <h2><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/star_wars_battlefront_2">Time to excute order 66 or join the EA Empire?</a></h2>
		  </center>
		   <p><img src="images/starwars.png" alt="starwars" align="middle"> Battlefront 2 has had quite the journey to release, hasn’t it? From the promise of more and better content at its E3 showing to the whole microtransaction catastrophe But is the game a quality one?</p> 
            <center>
		  <h2><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/need_for_speed_payback">The Need for the Grind</a></h2>
		  </center>
		   <p><img src="images/need4speed.png" alt="need4" align="middle"> not sure about The Fast and the Furious, but Need for Speed Payback sure will make you furious fast. Ghost Games has spent two years tuning up EA’s flagship racing brand following 2015’s disappointing reboot,but it hasn’t made much progress</p>

		  <h2><a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/destiny_2">Is it your Destiny to Play this Game</a></h2>
		  </center>
		   <p><img src="images/destiny.png" alt="Destiny" align="middle">Three years after the release of Destiny,a whole new title that's framed as a direct sequel has arrived. This fresh release was Bungie's best bet to start enticing new players while also catering for veterans,so we got a very familiar but improved game</p>

		  <h2><a href="http://ie.ign.com/articles/2017/05/22/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review">Pubg=DayZ without the wait?</a></h2>
		  </center>
		   <p><img src="images/pubg.png" alt="Pub" align="middle"> PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is still in Early Access but it’s already a groundbreaking online shooter.Each game starts the same way, but its ability to feel like a fresh new adventure every round has keeps you coming back for hours on end</p>
